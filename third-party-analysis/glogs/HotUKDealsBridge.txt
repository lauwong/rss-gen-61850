    [PepperBridgeAbstract,DealabsBridge,HotUKDealsBridge,MydealsBridge] Fix search URL, No results handling fixed, Thread title and Message URL handling (#4053)
    
    * [PepperBridgeAbstract,DealabsBridge,HotUKDealsBridge,MydealsBridge] Fix search URL, No results handling fixed, Thread title and Message URL handling
    
    Search URL has been updated according to the website.
    
    If a search doesn't return any results, the HTML won't contain any
    specific text now : the HTML structure is slightly different, so the
    bridge has been updated.
    
    The unnneded 'no-results' text is now removed from the specific bridges.
    
    The board thread title has been removed from the content, so now we use
    the page <title> element.
    
    In case a board message is empty, there was an exception during the
    filtering of message without URL.

    [PepperBridgeAbstract,DealabsBridge,HotUKDealsBridge,MydealsBridge] Move as much as possible to JSON (#4032)
    
    As the website use more and more JSON, and JSON is a machine readable
    format, I migrated as much as possible to the JSON.
    
    This simplifies the Abstract class a lot, and the Bridge classes need
    less language specifi strings.

    [DealabsBridge-HotUKDealsBridge-MydealsBridge-PepperBridgeAbstract] Fix (#2789)
    
    the date handling
    
    The deal posting date logic was wrong, and leaded to warnings and
    notice. Now, only the feed with the deal sorted by date contains date
    (the feed sorted by hottest deal does not contain a date anymore,
    because there are no deal date in this case).

    * [PepperBridge] Fix some Notice for expired items
    
    Some expired iteams are not identical to normal items for the title and
