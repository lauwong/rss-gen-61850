    [ComicsKingdomBridge] Fix/Rewrite of ComicsKingdom Bridge (#4003)
    
    * Rewrite ComicsKingdom Bridge
    
    Rewrite of bridge as the existing one no longer works:
    - Now uses REST API
    - Added optional limit to get desired number of comics
    - Author now reflects the comic creators name
    - Feed name and comic titles now pulled from site
    - Added myself as the maintainer as I've been the one maintaining, and the existing code no longer is used
    
    * Change API to URI to pass test
    
    * Remove whitespace, add curly braces and switch to single quotes

    [ComicsKingdomBridge] Grab the last meta og:url content instead of first (#2484)
    
    There are now two og:url values on the page, the first no longer contains the necessary date URL for the bridge to work.  Finding the last og:url on the page restores the bridge to working order.
