    [Mailman2Bridge] fix message separation and improve "From_ lines" disambiguation   (#4156)
    
    * [Mailman2Bridge.php] enable PCRE_MULTILINE pattern modifier
    
    Enable PCRE_MULTILINE pattern modifier on mbox content parsing. Without it parsing monthly archives results in only a single message each.
    
    * [Mailman2Bridge.php] extend mbox "From_ lines" pattern
    
    Extend PCRE pattern matching individual "From_ lines" used to split single messages in mbox content.
    
    In addition to the matching line having to start with 'From ' it now also has to end with time and date (hh:mm:ss yyyy).
    
    This makes the pattern slightly more robust against accidental matches when a line within the actual message body starts with 'From ' which Mailman 2 (Pipermail) may not be configured to disambiguate.
    
    * [Mailman2Bridge.php] remove trailing slash from URI constant
