    [YouTubeCommunityTabBridge] Multi-image attachment support (#4091)
    
    Adds support for multi-image attachments.
    Also changes individual if-statments in "getAttachments" to if/elseif
    as each post can apparently only have one attachment anyway.

    [YouTubeCommunityTabBridge] Fix PHP warnings for posts w/o text (#3536)
    
    Because "contentText" is always present, PHP warnings were previously
    generated for posts without text.
    Existence of sub-property "runs" gets checked now to avoid this.

    [YouTubeCommunityTabBridge] Add timestamps (#3477)
    
    As YouTube doesn't provide precise dates for community posts, an
    increasing multiple of 60 seconds is subtracted from each timestamp.
    This ensures that the original order is always preserved, even if there
    are multiple posts with the same date (e.g. "1 month ago").
