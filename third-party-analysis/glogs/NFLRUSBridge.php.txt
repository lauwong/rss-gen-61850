    [NFLRUSBridge] Remove byte-order-mark (#2777)
    
    With UTF-8 byte-order mark in the file, the `ListActionTest::testOutput`
    would fail after converting tests to PSR-4 namespaces:
    
        invalid JSON output: Syntax error
        Failed asserting that null is not null.
    
    This is because ListAction::execute tries to create the bridge objects
    and, when the files containing the bridge classes are not loaded yet,
    the autoloader starts including them. Since this happens after output
    buffering has begun, any text in the PHP file before the `<?php` tag
    such as the BOM will end up in the buffer to be parsed by `json_decode`.
    
    Previously, it worked by chance thanks to some other test including the file
    before `ListActionTest`. With the restructuring, `Actions\ListActionTest`
    will run sooner and become responsible for triggering the autoloader.
    
    To prevent this in the future, I also disallowed BOM in the coding style.
