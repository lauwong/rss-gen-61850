    [PepperBridgeAbstract,DealabsBridge,HotUKDealsBridge,MydealsBridge] Fix search URL, No results handling fixed, Thread title and Message URL handling (#4053)
    
    * [PepperBridgeAbstract,DealabsBridge,HotUKDealsBridge,MydealsBridge] Fix search URL, No results handling fixed, Thread title and Message URL handling
    
    Search URL has been updated according to the website.
    
    If a search doesn't return any results, the HTML won't contain any
    specific text now : the HTML structure is slightly different, so the
    bridge has been updated.
    
    The unnneded 'no-results' text is now removed from the specific bridges.
    
    The board thread title has been removed from the content, so now we use
    the page <title> element.
    
    In case a board message is empty, there was an exception during the
    filtering of message without URL.

    [PepperBridgeAbstract,DealabsBridge,HotUKDealsBridge,MydealsBridge] Move as much as possible to JSON (#4032)
    
    As the website use more and more JSON, and JSON is a machine readable
    format, I migrated as much as possible to the JSON.
    
    This simplifies the Abstract class a lot, and the Bridge classes need
    less language specifi strings.

    Fix the Deal source link
    
    The HTML does not contain the link to the "Deal source anymore", now only an

    [PepperBridgeAbstract] Fix Detection of "no deals found" and more (#3821)
    
    - CSS styles showing there were no deals found has changed : CSS class
      was updated
    - Relative Date handling : the minimum granularity of a relative date is
      the minute on the site. Seconds are therefore meaningless, and are now deleted.
    
    MydealsBridge was missing one relateve date prefix : now every date is
    parsed (I hope so !)
