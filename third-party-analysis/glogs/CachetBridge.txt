    phpcs: Always use long array syntax
    
    Most of the code in RSS-Bridge uses the long array syntax.
    This commit adds a check to enforce using this syntax over
    the short array syntax.
    
    All failures have been fixed.

    [CachetBridge] Add new bridge (#1034)
    
    * Fix issue with CachetAPI Pagination
    
    Fixing issue that only the oldest 20 entries were shown.
    
    _Background:_
    
    _Cachet has a, lets call it odd, system of pagination. On the first page you see the incidents first created, so they are not what you want to see. But on the last page you can have 1 or 20 of the newest incidents. So you have to take the incidents from the last page (call it Pmax) and combine them with the incidents from  Pmax - 1._
