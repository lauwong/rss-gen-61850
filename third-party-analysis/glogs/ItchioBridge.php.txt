    [ItchioBridge] Remove reliance on in-page timestamps (#2127)
    
    This significantly increases the possibility of missing updates (if
    files are uploaded but no file names or post contents are changed) and
    of showing an update when there is none (if the post text is changed
    but no new files are uploaded). However with the on-page timestamps
    removed I'm not sure if there is a good way to do this more accurately
    so this is good as we can do at the moment.
