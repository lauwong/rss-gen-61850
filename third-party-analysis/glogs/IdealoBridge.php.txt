    [IdealoBridge] Really fix Logic and enhance Feed Content (#4321)
    
    - Fix Feed Title generation (wrong usage of loadCacheValue)
    - Use a more reliable way to get New and Used Price
    - If no new Price and no Used Price are present in the page, then don't
      delete previous New Price and previous Used Price
    - If there is no New Price and no Used Price, then return no Feed
      Item
    - Fix the "now" date format
    - Make the Feed Item Title more readable
    - Use the Product Link as the Feed URL

    [IdealoBridge] Fix (#4316)
    
    When a product was available before as used product in the past, and
    now it's not available used anymore, a price update article was
    generated on every feed loading, because the old used price was still
    stored in the cache, and therefore different as "no price".
    
    The issue was also present in the cas of a New product price that
    becomes unavailable.
    
    Now, when either there is no New or Used price available, the previous
    price is delete from the cache.

    [IdealoBridge] Fix price comparison and some PHP Notice (#4130)
    
    * [IdealoBridge] Fix price comparison and some PHP Notice
    
    - The prices were compared as String and the comparison was wrong in
      some case : now the price are converted to float before the
     comparison, so the logic works really.
    
    - Don't show a new or used product price if it does not exist : this
      prevents a PHP Notice to be thrown
    
    * [IdealoBridge] Fix price conversion in case the price is null
    
    The conversion as float of the text price won't work if the price is
    null : we retunr null in this case now.

    [IdealoBridge] Update Bridge Meta data & (#4022)
    
    The bridge meta data has been updated to reflect that the bridge works
    for other international version of Idealo.
    
    The Price trend is displayed on every price in the the Feed element
    content. The same function is now used to show the price trend in the
    Feed element title, to remove some duplicate code..
