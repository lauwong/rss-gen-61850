    [IPBBridge] fix: bug in feed detection logic
    
    The previous author forgot to also append ".xml"
    when actually fetching the detected feed.

    [IPBBridge] Use limit for the number of items
    
    The limit was used to specify the number of pages to return from a given
    topic which resulted in the number of returned items variing between one
    and however many entries are listed on one page.
    
    This commit changes the implementation for the limit to keep loading more
    pages until the specified limit is reached. Excessive elements are removed
    in order to return the exact amount of items specified by the limit.
    
    This behavior is closer to how other bridges are implemented and makes it
    more natural to use without being too confusing. Existing queries must be
    updated to account for the new limit.

    [IPBBridge] Add bridge (#564)
    
    This bridge returns feeds for any URI that is compatible with the
    IPB implementation (currently 4.x). Older versions might work, but
    there is no guarantee.
    
    Only forum and topic URIs are supported!
    
    The bridge automatically checks if natural feeds are available (by
    adding '.xml' to the URI). If so the feed is returned. Otherwise
    the bridge will attempt to identify the content type and build a
    feed accordingly.
    
    Valid URIs are forums and topics. For forums the first page is
    returned, for topics the last one. Elements are ordered such that
    the latest entry is returned first (oldest-to-newest)
    
    The optional parameter '&limit=' specifies how many pages should
    be loaded (default: 1). Topics are loaded in reverse order.
    => Does not work with forums!
    
    Images are provided as enclosures and scaled to a max-size of
    400x400 pixels by default (Except for natural feeds).
    
    The content is filtered before being returned:
    - Unnecessary tags are removed (iframes, etc...)
    - Styles for blockquotes are restored (grey background)
    
    Closes #507
