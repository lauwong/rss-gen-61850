    [PepperBridgeAbstract,DealabsBridge,HotUKDealsBridge,MydealsBridge] Fix search URL, No results handling fixed, Thread title and Message URL handling (#4053)
    
    * [PepperBridgeAbstract,DealabsBridge,HotUKDealsBridge,MydealsBridge] Fix search URL, No results handling fixed, Thread title and Message URL handling
    
    Search URL has been updated according to the website.
    
    If a search doesn't return any results, the HTML won't contain any
    specific text now : the HTML structure is slightly different, so the
    bridge has been updated.
    
    The unnneded 'no-results' text is now removed from the specific bridges.
    
    The board thread title has been removed from the content, so now we use
    the page <title> element.
    
    In case a board message is empty, there was an exception during the
    filtering of message without URL.

    [PepperBridgeAbstract,DealabsBridge,HotUKDealsBridge,MydealsBridge] Move as much as possible to JSON (#4032)
    
    As the website use more and more JSON, and JSON is a machine readable
    format, I migrated as much as possible to the JSON.
    
    This simplifies the Abstract class a lot, and the Bridge classes need
    less language specifi strings.

    This commit fixes #782 by updating the parameter value of 'Maison &
